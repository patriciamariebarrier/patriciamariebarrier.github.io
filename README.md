About 5 days ago Github was just a word to me...Then someone recommended that I build a page on a bit of a time crunch to show some of my data science projects. 
After trying to start from scratch (and even referring to the pages of some colleagues), I decided to find a good template to work with - and I was fortunate to find this one.

Because of the rushed time constraints, I wasn't as tidy as I would typically be while updating and turning the template into my own stuff - but having their well-organized, well-commented template made life much easier for me and I'm happy with how my page looks. 
(I should probably mention that, while I have some coding background, I'm not a developer so I was "pattern coding" many times, since this code integrates a few different languages, during my race to the end!) 

As time allows, I may revisit to clean up some of my page titles, but I must say for a quick 5-day portfolio creation - I am very happy. 
I'm thankful to Argon & Jekyll for their solid template foundation.
