        <p class="lead">I am currently a non-tenure track lecturer at Appalachian State University. While I have over 15 years of experience teaching a range of college mathematics and statistics courses, my speciality is teaching statistics. My educational background includes mathematical theory, applied mathematics, statistics, and computer programming. Graduate work for my first masters degree at Appalachian State University was focused in mathematical theory and statistics. Graduate work for my current masters degree program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte is focused in data science and business analytics. <br> <br> I am passionate about data science because it brings statistics to life in so many ways. My personality type is that of an explorer and an inventor. I thrive when given an idea to run with and grow because I enjoy asing outside the box "what if" questions. Sometimes this insatible curiousity can take me down a rabbit hole, but more times than not I am able mull over big questions from different angles for a bit and then funnel cool ideas down to solid results.
